# Fer2013-data-set-training---78-accurate
Data set training  process for identifying facial expressions 78% good accuracy. Used Deep Learning with CNN algorithm

deep learning model is trained to identify the facial expressions(emotions) of the speaker using the video of the speech. The model was developed using Conventional Neural Network with Keras. Fer2013 is the dataset that is used to build this model. The dataset consists of seven categories of emotions. (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). But the trained model has only four categories of emotions for the sake of accuracy. Those are ‘Angry’, ’Happy’, ’Sad’ and ‘Neutral’
